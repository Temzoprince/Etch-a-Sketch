# Etch-a-Sketch

Creates a grid on the page in which the user can draw whatever they like using the mouse - they just have to hover over the cell

You can change the grid size by clicking on any of the buttons. Users can create a grid of up to 100x100.

There are 3 effects users can choose in creating a grid
1. The grid color is the same as the initial grid
2. The grid color is randomized
3. The grid color starts as white and progressively darkens to be black as the user passes over 10 cells
